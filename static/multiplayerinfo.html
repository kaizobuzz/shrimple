            You have 6 guesses to get the correct shrimp.<br>
            The shrimp image under each field shows the
            correctness of the field.<br>

            <summary>Timer</summary>
            There is a timer on the bottom that keeps moving.
            The timer resets when you guess a shrimp.
            If the timer runs out, a guess gets skipped.<br>
            In Multiplayer Mode, after each correct guess, your opponent's
            timer permanently speeds up.
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Effects</summary>
            In Multiplayer Mode, after each guess, you can send an effect to your opponent. <br>
            You can switch the current effect you're sending with a keypress, listed beside the effect name <br>
            The effect, if not instant, lasts 4 guesses.<br>
            The effects can be of the following:<br>
            <b>(0)Guess Field Hide:</b> While this effect is active, each
            field of the shrimp has a chance of its comparison being hidden.<br>
            <b>(1)Reduced Time Limit:</b> The timer turns red and the time limit is
            reduced while this effect is active.
            <b>(2)Disabled Autofill:</b> The autofill is disabled while this
            effect is active.<br>
            <b>(3)Garbage Shrimp:</b> Two of your shrimp guesses are done for you,
            with them having 4 out of 6 of their comparisons being hidden.<br>
            <b>(4)Bomb Party:</b> You are given a three letter prompt and you
            must submit a shrimp that includes that prompt within 15
            seconds or lose a life. Note that the prompt may include
            parts of multiple words, eg. sts with Bay Gho<b>st S</b>hrimp.
            The autofill is disabled while this effect is active.<br>
